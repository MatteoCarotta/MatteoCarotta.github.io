                <p>Briefing is the first and most important process in project management, which a client informs others of his or her needs, aspirations and desires. “Briefing” can be considered almost synonymous with concepts of “Architectural Programming” and “Scope Management”. At the pre-design stage, briefing helps clients to define their design problems by translating their needs into written project requirements such as functional performance criteria, quality standards, etc.. Although these requirements normally act as a basis for approaching designers, since they are solution neutral an extended role for briefing can be easily hypothesized: By engaging the client in even earlier stage solutions other then new construction can be assessed. In this new context any solution compliant with the requirements can be validated, therefor the outcome can be very different: Upgrading, Renovating, New Construction, Community Builders, Renting, Property acquisition etc.<br><br>
Engaging the client even earlier may presents some difficulties: the scope to manage is very broad, the result is uncertain, the client is not committed yet, it may be a considerably time consuming stage.
It is mater of the solutions presented by SPACE.around to investigate how to engage successfully the client in such a early stage by mean of ICT solutions.<br><br>
We at SPACE.around are thinking about a platform that empowers business searching for the best space for their activities that take into consideration all the needs of an enterprise : Attractiveness for talents, Proximity to Partners, Responsiveness to network, Availability, Affordability and Suitability according to activities. On one hand the proposed web platform starts engaging enterprises in a playful manner by profiling and guiding them throughout the process of formulating the requirements best fitting the needs of their business, than a matching algorithm considering multiple parameters groups the enterprises into areas of interest each of which is assigned with a project proposal that best fit the client requirements.</p>
